# Introduction to major and minor scales
notes from 2022 JUN 02 \
introductio by Erik Svensson \

There are 12 notes, A-G, alphabetically. Scales are made of 7 notes. The sequence these are played will determine how the brain interprets the music, e.g. major or minor \
The major scale starts in C and proceeds as D, E, F, G, A, B. These are all white keys on a piano. C is located directly left of the first black key that is in a cluster of two black keys \
The black keys are sometimes referred to as half-notes. The distance (in pitch) from a black to a white key is the the same as from a black key to an adjacent white key.\
These, half-tones, can be considered as steps. A scale is defined by the the sequence of distances $\Delta$ between notes (keys) as played from left to right. For the major scale
$$\Delta_{major}=\left(2,1,2,2,1,2,2\right)$$
Regardless of which key is the initial
