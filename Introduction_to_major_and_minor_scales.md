# Introduction to major and minor scales
notes from 2022 JUN 02 <br/>
introduction by Erik Svensson at ungdomens hus<br/>

There are 12 notes, A-G, alphabetically. Scales are made of 7 notes. The sequence these are played will determine how the brain interprets the music, e.g. major or minor <br/>
The major scale starts in C and proceeds as D, E, F, G, A, B. These are all white keys on a piano. C is located directly left of the first black key that is in a cluster of two black keys <br/>
The distance between two adjacent keys (regardless of color, note than two white keys are not adjacent if there is a black key between them), is sometimes referred to as a semitone (or half step). The distance (in pitch) between all adjacent keys is the same. These, semitones, will be considered here as full steps, and referred to simply as steps. <br/>

A scale is defined by the initial tone, referred to as the **keynote**, and the sequence of distances $\Delta$ in the direction from lower to higher pitch. The keys within a scale are more likely to sound good when played in sequence, i.e. in a melody <br/>
The minor **major scale** is defined by the sequence (measured in semitones):   
$$\Delta_{major}=\left(2,2,1,2,2,2,1\right)$$
The minor **minor scale** is defined by the sequence (measured in semitones):   
$$\Delta_{minor}=\left(2,1,2,2,1,2,2\right)$$
Regardless of keynote in both cases. <br/>
